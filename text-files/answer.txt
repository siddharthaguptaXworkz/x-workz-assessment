1. In compile time, the program files is coverted from source code to byte code. This byte code is platform independent. 
In run time, the program files are converted from byte code to machine code and executed by the operating system. This machine code is not platform independent.
2.See program-files/DataType.java
3. See program-files/Convert.java
4. Method is an encapsulation of a series of logical statements which get executed chronologically. 
Parameter states what datatype is expected in the method and what it gets referred to as within the method.
Arguement is passed in at run-time from a calling function. We must pass in method statements 
Return Type is what a method is expected to return to the calling function. If nothing is returned, return-type is void. 
See program-files/Cat.java
5. Encapsulation is a method of coupling the data and methods through a class. 
Everything that a class can do must be wrapped into the methods.
Everything that represents a class must be included in as fields.
See program-files/Animal.java and program-files/AnimalTester.java
6. Array is a 0-indexed series of homogenous element which are stored contiguosly in memory.
7.See program-files/Array.java
8. Method overloading is when there is a method with the same name, but there is a change in; the order or parameters, types of parameters or the number of parameters
